# LoveInTheApocalypse
This project is currently "under construction". 

A Zombie themed game using React, React-Router, React Toolbox, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Passport and Bcrypt 
Includes user sign-up/sign-in/log out with user authentication, hashed password and persistent data that allows user to return to the game where they left off. User information including game play progress is stored in a mongoose user model.

The object of the game is to gain the most points, win the Zombie's love and the game. The user starts with a set amount of health points and the progress bar indicates how close they are to winning / losing the game. The user can choose which character they wish to play with. Each character has a set of 10 questions with 4 possible responses. Each response has a pre-determined positive or negative point value.

The 'views' have been broken down into React components using React Toolbox. "React Toolbox is a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design Specification." It's powered by CSS Modules and the webpack workflow. React Toolbox usses CSS modules to import stylesheets written SASS. 

Quicktime/Gif showing the game play will be included.
